# Notes for Numerical Semigroups and Generalized Numerical Semigroups

A small collection of Jupyter Notebooks for studying Numerical Semigroups and Generalized Numerical Semigroups (GNSs).

## Description

These Jupyter Notebooks are being used in my undergraduate thesis to compute examples and implement new routines for Numerical Semigroups and Generalized Numerical Semigroups (GNSs) using [**SageMath**](https://www.sagemath.org/), [**GAP**](https://www.gap-system.org/) and the [**Numericalsgps**](https://github.com/gap-packages/numericalsgps) package.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* SageMath
* GAP (Already comes with SageMath)
* Numericalsgps package

### Installing

* First, you need to install SageMath in your OS ([Check the SageMath guide for especific details](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/)). I recommend [this guide](http://cientic.uis.edu.co/grupobioquimicateorica/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Installation_of_Sage_in_WSL.pdf) for Windows Users.
* Since a barebones version of GAP comes with SageMath, there's no need to install it on it's own. 
* However, there's a problem with the Numericalsgps package: It's not pre-installed within SageMath's version of GAP. We can solve this problem by [installing it ourselves](Numericalsgps-on-SageMath)

### Usage

* TODO
* ONLY DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOKS
